## Description: 
Airbnb, Inc. is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. It lists more than 6 million rooms and houses in 81,000 cities. The platform has more than 150 million users worldwide with 2 million people staying Airbnb rentals across the world on any given night.
The Airbnb dataset contains two CSV files (train and test). They consist of 29 columns that describe the type of the property, price, amenities, number of rooms, number of bathrooms, etc.
Given the extremely large quantity of listings, finding a fair price with the required amenities for an Airbnb listing is a problem. The fact that only 11% of the nearly 500,000 US listings are reserved on a typical night, so clearly there is a lot of room for improvement. 
<br />
The project attempts to find the solutions for:
<ul>
<li>“What can be improved or provided in a listing to attract customers?”</li>
<li>“In which locations are Airbnb’s more and are in demand?”</li>
<li>“What is a decent price for an Airbnb listing based on parameters like bedrooms, amenities, and other important factors?”</li>
 </ul>
